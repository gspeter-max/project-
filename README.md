Problem 1: Time Series Anomaly Detection & Forecasting with Pandas & Numpy
You are given a dataset that represents hourly sales data for a retail store over the past year. The dataset has 3 columns:

timestamp (datetime object)
sales (numeric)
store_id (categorical representing multiple stores)
Objective:

Use pandas and numpy to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring that there are no missing timestamps or sales data.
Implement a method to detect anomalies in sales patterns. Anomalies might be days with significantly higher or lower sales than expected. Use techniques like moving averages or Z-score to detect anomalies.
Forecast the next month's sales using statistical techniques or machine learning methods (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or neural networks).
Compare the forecasting model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).


i am do that is my way
